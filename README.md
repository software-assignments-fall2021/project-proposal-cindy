# CompFood

## What and why?
Doordash, Uber Eats, Grubhub, Postmates, Seamless...and the list goes on. Despite the fact that they are all food delivery apps, many of them mark up prices in different ways -- the tax, service fee, tip, and even the menu prices differ from app to app. With the increasing need for consumers to deliver their food for its convenience and safety, it is becoming harder and harder for anyone to know which app offers the best prices and deals.

CompFood is a mobile/web app that will help you choose the best app for your order. All you do is pick a restaurant, pick from the menu, and CompFood will do the rest of the work for you -- comparing from app to app and suggesting the app with the cheapest prices and best deals for you! This app aims to help users save money for their order, and feel a little more at ease ordering food online.

## For whom?
This app can be used by virtually anyone. Typically, individuals who don't have time to cook or don't like to cook, might find this app the most helpful. However, with the advent of the coronavirus, social distancing and ordering food online has become more important, and even a safer option than going out to a restaurant for nearly everyone.

## How?
The general system of the app will work similarly to many of the food delivery apps. In this way, it will be easy and comfortable for users to navigate, and it makes sense too.
1. Display all nearby and available restaurants for online food delivery.
2. Restaurant menu items and prices taken from many of the apps' listed prices (and averaged).
3. Click on menu items to add to cart.
4. Once cart is finalized, display a list of apps with their corresponding total prices.
    - *Optional* Estimated delivery times as well
    - *Optional* Input tip % and add to subtotal for each app for an even more accurate representation of their prices

## Scope
This application will function very simiilarly to a food delivery app. With that in mind, and given the data mining necessary for this app to work, the scope of this project should comfortably fit the 4-6 programmer requirement. It will involve *lots* of both frontend and backend work, which will be more than enough for a team. Emulating a well-designed food delivery app will likely take a substantial amount of both time and effort.
